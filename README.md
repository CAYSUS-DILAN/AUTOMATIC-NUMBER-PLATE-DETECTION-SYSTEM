# AUTOMATIC-NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION-SYSTEM (Web Based Application with AI and Machine Learning)
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology like magic for reading vehicle license plates.  Instead of needing a person to look at a camera feed, ANPR uses  image processing to automatically identify and decipher the letters and numbers on a plate.  This can be done in real-time from videos or from still images.

Automatic number plate detection (ANPD), also known as Automatic Vehicle
Identification (AVI), can be implemented using existing multi-purpose CCTV surveillance
cameras or dedicated ANPD cameras. These systems use optical character recognition (OCR)
software to isolate and identify vehicle registration details. This technology is typically
utilized for automatic toll collection, or to detect speeding violations, but can also be used to
monitor vehicle movement and for access control. A typical ANPD system includes
hardware and software components including roadside camera systems, control centre
computer systems, software Applications to manage captured data, and a central database of
vehicle registration details. 

There are two different approaches to data processing:

Images are captured by camera equipment and sent directly to the control centre
with time, date and location information without any pre-processing. The central
computer system utilizes OCR software which uses a set of algorithms to isolate
vehicle registration
details, and then compares this information with a database of known vehicle
registration numbers to display driver and vehicle information. 

Images are captured by the camera equipment and processed immediately at the
camera location by an embedded OCR processing unit on the camera. The isolated
registration number is then transmitted to the control centre along with time, date and
location data where it is compared with a database to provide driver and vehicle
information. In the source data processing method, the OCR process takes
approximately a quarter of a second with modern equipment and transmission can be
achieved wirelessly with different radio transmission systems depending on the type
and quantity of data to be sent.

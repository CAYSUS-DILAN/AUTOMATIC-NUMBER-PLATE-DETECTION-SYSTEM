# AUTOMATIC-NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology like magic for reading vehicle license plates.  Instead of needing a person to look at a camera feed, ANPR uses  image processing to automatically identify and decipher the letters and numbers on a plate.  This can be done in real-time from videos or from still images.
